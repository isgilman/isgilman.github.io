summary: Harnessing the power of any species with comparative biology
abstract: 'With over 300,000 species, flowering plants are one of the most diverse groups of organisms. This diversity is a limitless resource for the development of novel materials and drugs, and provides examples of how nature has already solved many of the challenges of today. Comparative biology uses evolutionary theory to reconstruct how species gained the adaptations they have today, and can provide roadmaps to improving crops in the face of global climate change.'
