abstract: C4 and CAM photosynthesis have repeatedly evolved in plants over the past
  30 million years. Because both repurpose the same set of enzymes but differ in their
  spatial and temporal deployment, they have long been considered as distinct and
  incompatible adaptations. Portulaca contains multiple C4 species that perform CAM
  when droughted. Spatially explicit analyses of gene expression reveal that C4 and
  CAM systems are completely integrated in Portulaca oleracea, with CAM and C4 carbon
  fixation occurring in the same cells and CAM-generated metabolites likely incorporated
  directly into the C4 cycle. Flux balance analysis corroborates the gene expression
  findings and predicts an integrated C4+CAM system under drought. This first spatially
  explicit description of a C4+CAM photosynthetic metabolism presents a potential
  new blueprint for crop improvement. Portulaca oleracea has a rare metabolism derived
  from the integration of C4 and CAM photosynthesis.
