abstract: Premise Phylogenetic relationships within major angiosperm clades are increasingly
  well resolved, but largely informed by plastid data. Areas of poor resolution persist
  within the Dipsacales, including placement of Heptacodium and Zabelia, and relationships
  within the Caprifolieae and Linnaeeae, hindering our interpretation of morphological
  evolution. Here, we sampled a significant number of nuclear loci using a Hyb-Seq
  approach and used these data to infer the Dipsacales phylogeny and estimate divergence
  times. Methods Sampling all major clades within the Dipsacales, we applied the Angiosperms353
  probe set to 96 species. Data were filtered based on locus completeness and taxon
  recovery per locus, and trees were inferred using RAxML and ASTRAL. Plastid loci
  were assembled from off-target reads, and 10 fossils were used to calibrate dated
  trees. Results Varying numbers of targeted loci and off-target plastomes were recovered
  from most taxa. Nuclear and plastid data confidently place Heptacodium with Caprifolieae,
  implying homoplasy in calyx morphology, ovary development, and fruit type. Placement
  of Zabelia, and relationships within the Caprifolieae and Linnaeeae, remain uncertain.
  Dipsacales diversification began earlier than suggested by previous angiosperm-wide
  dating analyses, but many major splitting events date to the Eocene. Conclusions
  The Angiosperms353 probe set facilitated the assembly of a large, single-copy nuclear
  dataset for the Dipsacales. Nevertheless, many relationships remain unresolved,
  and resolution was poor for woody clades with low rates of molecular evolution.
  We favor expanding the Angiosperms353 probe set to include more variable loci and
  loci of special interest, such as developmental genes, within particular clades.
