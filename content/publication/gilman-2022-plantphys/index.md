abstract: C4 photosynthesis and Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) have been considered
  as largely independent adaptations despite sharing key biochemical modules. Portulaca
  is a geographically widespread clade of over 100 annual and perennial angiosperm
  species that primarily use C4 but facultatively exhibit CAM when drought stressed,
  a photosynthetic system known as C4 + CAM. It has been hypothesized that C4 + CAM
  is rare because of pleiotropic constraints, but these have not been deeply explored.
  We generated a chromosome-level genome assembly of Portulaca amilis and sampled
  mRNA from P. amilis and Portulaca oleracea during CAM induction. Gene co-expression
  network analyses identified C4 and CAM gene modules shared and unique to both Portulaca
  species. A conserved CAM module linked phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase to starch
  turnover during the day–night transition and was enriched in circadian clock regulatory
  motifs in the P. amilis genome. Preservation of this co-expression module regardless
  of water status suggests that Portulaca constitutively operate a weak CAM cycle
  that is transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally upregulated during drought.
  C4 and CAM mostly used mutually exclusive genes for primary carbon fixation, and
  it is likely that nocturnal CAM malate stores are shuttled into diurnal C4 decarboxylation
  pathways, but we found evidence that metabolite cycling may occur at low levels.
  C4 likely evolved in Portulaca through co-option of redundant genes and integration
  of the diurnal portion of CAM. Thus, the ancestral CAM system did not strongly constrain
  C4 evolution because photosynthetic gene networks are not co-regulated for both
  daytime and nighttime functions.
