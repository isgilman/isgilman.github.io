abstract: The dioecious and andromonoecious Solanum taxa (the “S. dioicum group”)
  of the Australian Monsoon Tropics have been the subject of phylogenetic and taxonomic
  study for decades, yet much of their basic biology is still unknown. This is especially
  true for plant-animal interactions, including the influence of fruit form and calyx
  morphology on seed dispersal. We combine field/greenhouse observations and specimen-based
  study with phylogenetic analysis of seven nuclear regions obtained via a microfluidic
  PCR-based enrichment strategy and high-throughput sequencing, and present the first
  species-tree hypothesis for the S. dioicum group. Our results suggest that epizoochorous
  trample burr seed dispersal (strongly linked to calyx accrescence) is far more common
  among Australian Solanum than previously thought and support the hypothesis that
  the combination of large fleshy fruits and endozoochorous dispersal represents a
  reversal in this study group. The general lack of direct evidence related to biotic
  dispersal (epizoochorous or endozoochorous) may be a function of declines and/or
  extinctions of vertebrate dispersers. Because of this, some taxa might now rely
  on secondary dispersal mechanisms (e.g. shakers, tumbleweeds, rafting) as a means
  to maintain current populations and establish new ones.
