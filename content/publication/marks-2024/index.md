abstract: Desiccation tolerance has evolved repeatedly in plants as an adaptation
  to survive extreme environments. Plants use similar biophysical and cellular mechanisms
  to survive life without water, but convergence at the molecular, gene and regulatory
  levels remains to be tested. Here we explore the evolutionary mechanisms underlying
  the recurrent evolution of desiccation tolerance across grasses. We observed substantial
  convergence in gene duplication and expression patterns associated with desiccation.
  Syntenic genes of shared origin are activated across species, indicative of parallel
  evolution. In other cases, similar metabolic pathways are induced but using different
  gene sets, pointing towards phenotypic convergence. Species-specific mechanisms
  supplement these shared core mechanisms, underlining the complexity and diversity
  of evolutionary adaptations to drought. Our findings provide insight into the evolutionary
  processes driving desiccation tolerance and highlight the roles of parallel and
  convergent evolution in response to environmental challenges. Marks et al. explore
  the repeated evolution of desiccation tolerance in grasses. Their analysis of diverse
  resurrection grasses reveals significant genetic convergence and parallel evolution,
  suggesting a shared foundation for adapting to extreme drought.
