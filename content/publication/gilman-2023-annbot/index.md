abstract: The growth of experimental studies of crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM)
  in diverse plant clades, coupled with recent advances in molecular systematics,
  presents an opportunity to re-assess the phylogenetic distribution and diversity
  of species capable of CAM. It has been more than two decades since the last comprehensive
  lists of CAM taxa were published, and an updated survey of the occurrence and distribution
  of CAM taxa is needed to facilitate and guide future CAM research. We aimed to survey
  the phylogenetic distribution of these taxa, their diverse morphology, physiology
  and ecology, and the likely number of evolutionary origins of CAM based on currently
  known lineages.We found direct evidence (in the form of experimental or field observations
  of gas exchange, dayâ€“night fluctuations in organic acids, carbon isotope ratios
  and enzymatic activity) for CAM in 370 genera of vascular plants, representing 38
  families. Further assumptions about the frequency of CAM species in CAM clades and
  the distribution of CAM in the Cactaceae and Crassulaceae bring the currently estimated
  number of CAM-capable species to nearly 7 % of all vascular plants. The phylogenetic
  distribution of these taxa suggests a minimum of 66 independent origins of CAM in
  vascular plants, possibly with dozens more. To achieve further insight into CAM
  origins, there is a need for more extensive and systematic surveys of previously
  unstudied lineages, particularly in living material to identify low-level CAM activity,
  and for denser sampling to increase phylogenetic resolution in CAM-evolving clades.
  This should allow further progress in understanding the functional significance
  of this pathway by integration with studies on the evolution and genomics of CAM
  in its many forms.
